# Flurps Engine written in C from scratch.
  
This setup is for Windows builds. However, can be adjust / adapted for Linux.  
  
Currently only proven to work on Windows 10. 
  
NOTE : Makefile has been included. And as of today January 3rd, 2023, I am no longer working on this project. This was just for testing shader rendering with a texture as a target.  
  
This project has been updated to latest working logging.h file, as well as latest GLAD version 2.0.2.  
  
GCC / MinGW x64 11.2

The texture node in this picture is dragable, and it stays put when you release the mouse.
