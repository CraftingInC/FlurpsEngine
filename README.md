This setup is for Windows builds. However, can be adjust / adapted for Linux.  
  
Currently only proven to work on Windows 10. 
  
NOTE : Makefile has been included. And as of today December 23rd, 2022, I am no longer working on this project. This was just for testing shader rendering with a texture as a target.  
  
GCC / MinGW x64 11.2
